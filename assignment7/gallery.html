        up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes. Something strange on the detector
        circuit. The weapons must have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but
        inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters. Captain, the most elementary and valuable
        statement in science, the beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off. Run a manual sweep of
        anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by 3,000
        percent. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What is the strength of the
        ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period would make this a local
        phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation?
